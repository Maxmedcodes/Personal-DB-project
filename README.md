# Personal-DB-project
Created my first Backend DB Project
I used: Node.js and Postgres for background
Project creates a html page which has a Form in whcih User enters their name and a country which adds this to postgres  DB called visited_countries
then I use Node.js to get results from DB into a HTML Table which increases with the number of entries in the DB
